# Code Word
Code Word is a fun game for people of all ages where you try to guess the word Alexa is thinking of.  Each round, she'll give you clues as to what the Code Word is.  You can make a guess, ask for the next clue, or ask her to repeat the last clue she gave you.  The less clues you need, the more points you earn!  New Code Words and clues are added weekly.

Alexa keeps track of your total score after each game you finish (must complete all 5 rounds).  Compete with your family and friends, and unlock different game modes the more points you earn.

If you have suggestions or feedback, please reach out to me at josh@userdel.com.  I read every email and take all customer feedback to heart.  If you enjoyed the game, I would appreciate a 5 star review to help support development of this game and future skills for Alexa.
