# Words with Clues
Clue Countdown is a fun game for people of all ages where you try to guess the words Alexa is thinking of. Each round, she'll give you clues as to what the word is. You can make a guess, ask for the next clue, or ask her to repeat the last clue she gave you. The less clues you need, the more points you earn! New words and clues are added regularly so check back often and keep that total score climbing. If you are using Voice Profiles, Alexa will let you know how you're stacking up against your family too for a little friendly competition!

If you have suggestions or feedback, please reach out to me at support@perfect4alexa.com. I read every email and take all customer feedback to heart. If you enjoyed the game, I would appreciate a 5 star review to help support development of this game and future skills for Alexa.
